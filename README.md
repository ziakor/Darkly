#Darkly

## Description
As an introductory project to computer security in the specific domain of the web, this project will make you dissect a vulnerable web site. In doing so, you will develop your own way of thinking about security in a web application and become aware of the problems associated with simple development errors, both from a programming and a design point of view.
